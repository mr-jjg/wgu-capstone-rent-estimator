# Rent Estimation App

This simple machine learning project estimates monthly rent prices based on 
home features using a Ridge Regression model trained on Zillow housing data.

## How to Run

- This app runs locally using the command line interface.
- No GUI is required.
- All paths are relative; ensure you're in the src/ folder when running scripts.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- joblib

### 1. Install all dependencies
From the `src/` folder, run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

### 2. Clean the Data
Run 'clean_data.py' to clean and preprocess the raw dataset.
This will generate cleaned.csv in the data/ folder.

### 3. Train the Model
Run 'train_data.py' to train the Ridge Regression model using the cleaned dataset.
This saves the trained model and transformer in the models/ folder.

### 4. Predict Monthly Rent

Run 'predict_rent.py' to estimate rent based on user input.
Follow the prompts in the terminal to enter home details.

## Sample workflow

### Input:
Zipcode (e.g., 90210): 99205
Number of Bedrooms (e.g., 2): 3
Number of Bathrooms (e.g., 2): 1.75
Area of unit in square feet (e.g., 1500): 1440
Listed Price (e.g., 350000): 327400
Number of units in building: 1

### Output:
Estimated Monthly Rent: $1,986.58

    
## Visualizations

This project includes four visualizations located in the `visuals/` folder:

1. **Rent_vs_Area.png** – Scatterplot of Area (sq ft) vs Rent Estimate
2. **Correlation_Heatmap.png** – Correlation matrix of numeric features
3. **Pairplot_Rent_Predictors.png** – Pairplot of RentEstimate with key predictors
4. **Rent_by_Bedroom.png** – Boxplot of Rent Estimate by Bedroom count

- A file named `vis_scripts.txt` is included in the `visuals/` folder
  to show how each plot was generated using Python and seaborn.
